#  -- Notes --
# Considering a benchmark was asked, I assume that time to process data
# is important and thus added additional data structure to speed up
# process time.
#
# Using a SQL database was considered, but the data could have been
# from an API endpoint and that felt a bit pointless without further
# information
#
# The data_map should be another class of it's own used to generate
# reports but it also may be a potential state of the front end (with
# modification).
#
# With report generation being the goal, data_map essentially the report
# and thus if new data was added to the CampaignCollection another
# data_map would need to be called
