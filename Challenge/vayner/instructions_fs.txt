The goal of this exercise is to simulate the creation of a report, by working with two datasets, and drawing some basic insights. Given the stated assumptions, please provide your answers to the following questions (in a .txt file), as well as your code. Please use either Python or Ruby.

source1.csv contains a list of campaigns, audiences and impressions served
    - the audience is composed of three elements separated by the delimiter "_"
    - the elements represent the state, hair color and age range of that campaign, respectively

source2.csv contains stats by day for each audience, broken out by ad_type
    - actions are a json string in the format [{'action': name, source: value}]
    - for example, {'action': 'conversions', A': 20} means source A reported 20 conversions

Do not disregard any data as invalid.

1. what was the total spent against people with purple hair?
2. how many campaigns spent on more than 4 days?
3. how many times did source H report on clicks?
4. which sources reported more "junk" than "noise"?
5. what was the total cost per view for all video ads, truncated to two decimal places?
6. how many source B conversions were there for campaigns targeting NY?
7. what combination of state and hair color had the best CPM?

BONUS - include a timestamp of the run time for your solution :)
