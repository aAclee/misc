Hi! I’m Karen and I’m running for office in the great state of MI.

State: MI

Candidate: (User?)
  Name: Karen,
  State: MI

I’d really like your help. 
I need a way to have my volunteers sign up to help me out. 
In particular I need them to be able to give me their first name, last name, middle initial, and date of birth. 
I also need to know what they are interested in.

Volunteers:
  First Name,
  Last Name,
  Middle Initial,
  Date of Birth,
  Interests

 Then I need to match them with the voter data that I have. 
 The format of the voter data will be name, age, location, phone number, and date last contacted.
 
 Voter:
  Name,
  Age,
  Location,
  Phone Number,
  Date (last contacted)
 
 Can you help me with that?

So a Campaign has a person running for office, and the state the campaign is in. A campaign can be multi-state too.

ORM Style
A Candidate belongs to a Campaign
A Volunteer belongs to a Campaign

A Voter has no relationship

NoSQL Style
Campaign Collection

  _id: {
    Candidate: String,
    State: String,
    Volunteers: [

        middleName: "J",

        Interests:  "Slow walks on the beach"

      },
