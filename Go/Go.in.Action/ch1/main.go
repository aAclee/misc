// Go programs are organized as packages
package main

// The import statement allows you to use external code.
// The fmt package from the standard library allows you to
// format and output data
import "fmt"

// Just like in C, the main function is what gets
// executed when the application is run
func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
